reMarkable Connection Utility (RCU)
===================================
RCU provides all-in-one offline management of the reMarkable e-paper 
tablet(s). Users may create and restore full backups, take screenshots, 
and manage notebooks, templates, wallpaper, and third-party software. 
It ensures the user's data is never out of their control, being lost to 
the manufacturer's proprietary "cloud" online synchronization.

The RCU program is licensed under the GNU GPLv3 (or later).

The RCU User Manual is the primary source of documentation. All the 
files in the ./manual directory are CC-BY-SA 4.0.

in this work refers to the company’s e-paper tablet product(s).
